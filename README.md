"# TriviaGame" 

Getting all the questions from the https://opentdb.com/api.php API

It asks 10 questions with multiple choice answers.
I shuffle the answers so the correct answer is always randomly placed
Keeping track of all correct, incorrect and non answered questions
Showing the results at the end of each game

Timers are for how long to answer each question and how long to display correct or incorrect answer.
